# BukkitApocalypticHorsemen
by Jonathan Hoffmann aka. Jonnyfant

Whenever a Skeleton Horse spawns in the world, there is a 5 % chance that the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse spawn as well. Usually Skeleton Horses spawn only as part of a skeleton Horse trap, so when a horse is struck by lightning.

##The Horsemen are:
###War
War rides on a red horse. His sword is very powerful and will be dropped when you defeat war.

###Famine
Famine rides a black horse. When you get attacked by famine you will suffer from the Hunger debuff. When you defeat famine, he will drop his powerful armor. The armor makes you more hungry while wearing it.

###Pestilence
Pestilence rides a green horse. Not much special with him, but you get to keep his ZombieHorse

###Death
Death rides a pale horse. He will one shot anybody that he attacks. He will drop his scythe, which will not be very useful.
